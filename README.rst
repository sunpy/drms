The ``drms`` module provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing HMI, AIA and MDI data with Python.
It uses the publicly accessible `JSOC <http://jsoc.stanford.edu/>`__ DRMS server by default, but can also be used with local `NetDRMS <http://jsoc.stanford.edu/netdrms/>`__ sites.
More information, including a detailed tutorial, is available in the `Documentation <https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/drms/>`__.
